I'm a Software Developer working in NYC.

Currently I am learning Go, Rust and working through the Standford ML course.
I'm writing this blog to get over my chronic fear of letting other people see my work.

### More Information

I graduated from the University at Buffalo '17 with a Computer Science B.S and a Math B.A.

My hobbies are starting random projects, calligraphy, and praying to the AI Gods to prevent another AI winter.
